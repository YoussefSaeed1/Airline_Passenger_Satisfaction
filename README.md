# Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction
Customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel, as well as ther evaluation of different factors like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.


# About the analysis:
This analysis is based on an airline passenger satisfaction dataset, which contains information about various aspects of airline services such as check-in, boarding, inflight entertainment, and food and drink. The dataset also includes information about the passengers' gender, age, and travel details such as the class of travel, customer type, and flight distance.

In this analysis, we explored the dataset to gain insights into the satisfaction levels of the passengers. We started by calculating the total number of passengers and the proportion of male and female passengers. We visualized this information using a pie chart with different colors for male and female passengers.

Next, we analyzed the average rating for different airline services and visualized this information using a horizontal bar chart. We also added the exact rating values above each bar for easy interpretation.

Finally, we examined the satisfaction levels of the passengers based on their class of travel and customer type. We visualized this information using a vertical bar chart with different colors for each category.

Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into the satisfaction levels of airline passengers and can be used by airlines to improve their services and customer satisfaction.
